# Project Connect v0.1.1 — Release Notes

Highlights
- Web marketplace: richer reviews UX (sorting, load more) and reusable Stars/ReviewItem components.
- Mobile marketplace: pull-to-refresh and sorting toggles, plus better busy-state handling.
- CI: lint job and optional Turbo Remote Cache.
- Storybook: stories for Stars, ReviewItem, and PackBuilder interaction flows.

Changes
- Web
  - Marketplace Detail: sort reviews by newest/highest/lowest and paginate with “Load more”.
  - Add Stars.tsx and ReviewItem.tsx; integrate into detail page.
  - Marketplace List: search and sort (newest/title).
  - PackBuilder stories: AddCardFlow, EditFirstCardFlow, and WithPackIdAndTitle.
- Mobile
  - Marketplace List: add pull-to-refresh and sorting toggles.
  - Marketplace Detail: average rating stars; follow/review disabled while busy.
- CI
  - Add lint job (pnpm workspace) and optional Turbo Remote Cache job (TURBO_TEAM/TURBO_TOKEN).

Verification
- Ran `pnpm -w test` locally: all packages green.
- Storybook: run `pnpm --filter web-app storybook` to preview components.

Notes
- Turbo remote cache is optional and requires repository/org variables/secrets.
- Deprecated warnings (punycode) from Node 22 are non-blocking.
