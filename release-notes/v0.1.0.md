# Project Connect ${VERSION} — Release Notes

Highlights
- All packages’ tests pass under Turbo: web, mobile, auth, creator, llm.
- Creator-service: fixed TypeScript issues and index handling in packs routes.
- Mobile app: Jest works under pnpm with proper transforms and RN polyfills.
- Web app: Onboard UI renders form during status check; PackBuilder tests stabilized.
- Root: pnpm override pins react-test-renderer for RN test compatibility.

Changes
- Root: pin react-test-renderer via pnpm overrides to ensure RN tests run under pnpm.
- Creator service: guard rowCount nullability, ensure computed insert index is numeric.
- Mobile app: update Jest transformIgnorePatterns for .pnpm paths; map react-test-renderer@18; add setImmediate polyfill.
- Web app: render Onboard form while status check runs; mock AuthContext in tests; search by HTTP method in fetch assertions; debounce-aware autosave tests.

Verification
- Ran `pnpm -w test` → all suites green across packages.

Notes
- Node 22 emits deprecated punycode warnings during tests (non-blocking).
- Web app currently uses React 19; consider aligning versions across web/mobile if needed.
