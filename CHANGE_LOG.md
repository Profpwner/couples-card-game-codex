- Fix duplicate import/route bug in creator-service src/index.ts and mount marketplace routes
 - Root: pin react-test-renderer via pnpm overrides to ensure RN tests run under pnpm

 - Mobile app: adjust Jest config for pnpm (.pnpm transformIgnore), map react-test-renderer@18, and add RN polyfills including setImmediate
